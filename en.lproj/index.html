<h1>About this Study</h1>
<p>
	For this study, researchers from the <a href="http://www.swisshcv.org" target="_blank">Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS)</a> are asking <i>people with hepatitis&nbsp;C</i> to use their smartphones to report information about themselves that may improve how hepatitis&nbsp;C is treated.
</p>
<p>
	This study is coordinated by the <a href="http://www.gastroenterologie.usz.ch" target="_blank">Clinic for Gastroenterology und Hepatology</a> at the University Hospital Zurich and is enrolling participants at other hospitals associated with the SCCS.

	Should you decide to participate, we will ask you to install our study app on your iPhone, get enrolled with the help of our study coordinator and complete your first survey.
</p>
<p>
	From now on you will get a <b>monthly</b> reminder to complete a survey via the app for the next <b>12 months</b>.
	You will be able to complete the surveys in the app, meaning you are free to do so at your leisure, there is <i>no need to visit the clinic</i> again.
	These surveys will take <b>approximately 10 minutes</b> of your time.
	Apart of that you are free to use the other features of the app as you please.

<h1>What is Hepatitis&nbsp;C?</h1>
<img class="float-left" src="../static/HepC.png" srcset="../static/HepC@2x.png 2x, ../static/HepC@3x.png 3x" alt="">
<p>
	Hepatitis&nbsp;C is a liver disease cause by <i>infection with hepatitis&nbsp;C virus</i> (HCV).
	Hepatitis&nbsp;C is a blood-borne virus.
</p>
<p>
	Most people with hepatitis&nbsp;C are in the “baby-boomer” generation and acquired their infections decades ago.
	Today, most people with new HCV infections become infected with the HCV by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs.
	For a minority of people, hepatitis&nbsp;C is a short-term illness, but for 70%–85% of people who become infected with hepatitis&nbsp;C, long-term, chronic infection follows.
	Although not everyone with chronic hepatitis&nbsp;C progresses to serious liver disease, chronic hepatitis&nbsp;C can be a serious disease than can result in long-term health problems, including liver scarring (which can lead to cirrhosis), liver failure, liver cancer, even death.
	The majority of infected persons might not be aware of their infection because they are not clinically ill.
</p>
<p>
	There is no vaccine for hepatitis&nbsp;C.
	The best way to prevent hepatitis&nbsp;C is by avoiding behaviors that can spread the disease, especially injecting drugs.
	Fortunately, highly effective, very well tolerated oral medications are available that, effectively, can cure hepatitis&nbsp;C, but their high cost has limited their broad application.
