About Hepatitis C
=================

The hepatitis C virus (HCV), formerly known as ‘non-A non-B’ hepatitis virus, was identified in 1989.
This blood-borne virus is endemic worldwide, with an estimated 170 million persons infected, representing approximately 3% of the world population.
The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in Switzerland is ranging from 0.7 to 1% of the general population. 
Long-term morbidity associated with persistent HCV infection includes the development of _cirrhosis_ and _primary liver cancer_: these long-term sequelae of HCV infection are the primary indication to liver transplantation in Switzerland and many other Western countries.

The majority of infected persons might not be aware of their infection because they are not clinically ill.

There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Fortunately, highly effective, very well tolerated oral medications are available that, effectively, can cure hepatitis C, but their high cost has limited their broad application.
