About this Study
================

For this study, researchers from the [Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS)](http://www.swisshcv.org) are asking _people with hepatitis&nbsp;C_ to use their smartphones to report information about themselves that may improve how hepatitis&nbsp;C is treated.

This study is coordinated by the [Clinic for Gastroenterology und Hepatology](http://www.gastroenterologie.usz.ch) at the University Hospital Zurich and is enrolling participants at other hospitals associated with the SCCS.

If you're interested in joining please contact one of the [SCCS Clinical Centers](http://www.swisshcv.org/clinical-centers.htm) in Switzerland.


How the Study Works
===================

Should you decide to participate, we will ask you to install our study app on your iPhone, get enrolled with the help of our study coordinator and complete your first survey.

From now on you will get a **monthly** reminder to complete a survey via the app for the **next 12 months**.
You will be able to complete the surveys in the app, meaning you are free to do so at your leisure, there is _no need to visit the clinic_ again.
These surveys will take **approximately 10 minutes** of your time.
Apart of that you are free to use the other features of the app as you please.
