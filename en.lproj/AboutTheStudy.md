About this Study
================

For this study, researchers from the [Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS)](http://www.swisshcv.org) are asking _people with hepatitis&nbsp;C_ to use their smartphones to report information about themselves that may improve how hepatitis&nbsp;C is treated.

This study is coordinated by the [Clinic for Gastroenterology und Hepatology](http://www.gastroenterologie.usz.ch) at the University Hospital Zurich and is enrolling participants at other hospitals associated with the SCCS.

If you're interested in joining please contact one of the [SCCS Clinical Centers](http://www.swisshcv.org/) in Switzerland.
